            <p>Machine Learning models are trained on data, and they learn the mapping or patterns in data so that they can make predictions based on their learning.There are two main types of machine learning:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Supervised Learning</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In this post we are going to discuss the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. But before that let's discuss what is supervised and unsupervised learning.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="supervised">
            <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data.<b>Labeled Data</b> means that the data
                contains the features(the things we know to predict something) as well as labels(which we want to
                predict). Let's suppose we want to predict the price of houses through supervised learning , we need
                labeled data which conatins important features like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>area of the house(5 marla, 10 marla etc)</li>
                <li>number of rooms(2,3,5 etc)</li>
                <li>number of bathrooms(1,2,3 etc)</li>
                <li>location of the house(city or village)</li>
                <li>condition of the house(new or old)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                And the label will be the price of the house. So our dataset will be labeled which means it will contain data of
                different houses, each row will contain the features of a house and the price of that house.Below is a sample dataset given for this putpose:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Area</th>
                    <th>Rooms</th>
                    <th>Bathrooms</th>
                    <th>Location</th>
                    <th>Condition</th>
                    <th>Price</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5 marla</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>City</td>
                    <td>Old</td>
                    <td>1000000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10 marla</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>Village</td>
                    <td>New</td>
                    <td>2000000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5 marla</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>City</td>
                    <td>New</td>
                    <td>1500000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10 marla</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>Village</td>
                    <td>Old</td>
                    <td>1800000</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                We can see that each row(group of features)  has a label(price) associated with it. So this is a labeled dataset and we can use it to train our model.     
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="unsupervised">
            <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <p>
                It is a type of machine learning in which the model is trained on unlabeled data.<b>Unlabeled Data</b> means that the data only contains features and no information about what label is associated with each row. Let's suppose we want to cluster the houses into different groups based on their features, we can use unsupervised learning for this purpose. We will use the same dataset as above but this time we will not include the price column. So our dataset will look like this:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Area</th>
                    <th>Rooms</th>
                    <th>Bathrooms</th>
                    <th>Location</th>
                    <th>Condition</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5 marla</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>City</td>
                    <td>Old</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10 marla</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>Village</td>
                    <td>New</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5 marla</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>City</td>
                    <td>New</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10 marla</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>Village</td>
                    <td>Old</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                We can see that there is no price column in this dataset. So this is an unlabeled dataset and we can use it to train our model.

                Ok so now we know what is supervised and unsupervised learning. Let's discuss the difference between them.

                Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
            </h3>
            <p>
                The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that in supervised learning the model is trained on labeled data while in unsupervised learning the model is trained on unlabeled data. <br>But if you thought deeply about these 2 types of learning there are some other differences as well.
