    <h1>How Assignment Operator Works in Python?</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Posted on October 24, 2023 by <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Shahzaib Hasaan</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that I learned recently about Python is how the assignment operator (=) works. In this article, I want to share my understanding of this concept and how it differs from other programming languages.</p>

    <p>An assignment statement is a way of giving a name to a value in Python. The name that we give to any value is called an identifier. For example, we can write:</p>

    <pre><code>a = 10 # assign the value 10 to the identifier a</code></pre>

    <p>In Python, every time we assign something to an identifier, an object (or an instance) of a certain class is created. A class is a blueprint that defines the attributes and behaviors of a type of object. Python has some built-in classes that represent common data types, such as int, float, str, list, dict, and so on. Python automatically detects the data type of the value and creates an object of that class.</p>

    <p>Every object in Python has a unique memory address where it is stored. When we assign an object to an identifier, the identifier points to the memory address of the object. In our example, the identifier 'a' points to the memory address of the object of the int class with the value 10.</p>

    <p>We can think of the identifiers in Python like pointers in C/C++ or reference variables in Java, which just point to the memory location of the objects. However, there are some differences as well:</p>

    <p>In C/C++, pointers have specific data types, such as int *, float *, or char *. When we declare a pointer, we also specify its type, and the pointer can only point to objects of that type. For example, we can write:</p>

    <pre><code>int *p = new int(10); // create a new int object with the value 10 and assign its address to p</code></pre>

    <p>This means that p is a pointer variable of type int *, and it can only point to int objects. If we try to assign a different type of object to p, such as a float or a char, we will get an error.</p>

    <p>In Java, reference variables have specific data types, such as Integer, Float, or String. When we declare a reference variable, we also specify its type, and the reference variable can only refer to objects of that type or its subclasses. For example, we can write:</p>

    <pre><code>Integer x = new Integer(10); // create a new Integer object with the value 10 and assign its alias to x</code></pre>

    <p>This means that x is a reference variable of type Integer, and it can only refer to Integer objects or objects of subclasses of Integer (such as Long or Short). If we try to assign a different type of object to x, such as a Float or a String, we will get an error.</p>

    <p>In Python, identifiers do not have specific data types. Instead, they are just names that point to objects. Objects have types, such as int, float, or str, but identifiers do not. For example, we can write:</p>

    <pre><code>a = 10 # create an int object with the value 10 and assign it to a</code></pre>

    <pre><code>a = "Hello" # create a str object with the value "Hello" and assign it to a</code></pre>

    <p>This means that a is an identifier that can point to any type of object. We can use the = operator to assign any value to a, and a will point to that object. In this case, a first points to an int object with the value 10, then it points to a str object with the value ‚ÄúHello‚Äù.</p>

    <p>I hope this article helps you understand how the assignment operator works in Python and how it differs from other programming languages. If you have any questions or feedback for me, please let me know in the comments section below. Thank you for reading! üòä</p>
